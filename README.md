Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Eli Cantwell, a creative enthusiast with a passion for bringing ideas to life through multimedia. I recently completed an intensive Web Development course at Dev Academy, eager to transition my skills from videography to crafting captivating digital experiences.

Throughout my career, I've honed my craft in videography, capturing moments that tell compelling stories. My experience extends beyond the lens; I've also delved into music production, leveraging my creativity to compose soundscapes that resonate.

I'm now on the lookout for opportunities to apply my newfound web development skills, blending my technical skill with a keen eye for design. Let's connect and explore how I can contribute to your team's digital journey!
